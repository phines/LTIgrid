\begin_layout Title
Block Diagram Derivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our dynamics are modeled by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{g}=P_{m}-D\Delta\omega-M\Delta\dot{\omega}\quad\left(1\right),
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{\delta}=\omega_{0}\Delta\omega\quad\left(2\right),
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{g}\dot{P}_{m}=P_{ref}+\Delta P_{c}-P_{m}-\frac{\Delta\omega}{R}\quad\left(3\right),
\]

\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{P}_{c}=-k\cdot ACE\quad\left(4\right).
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first equation, known as the Swing Equation, serves as the physical
 model of the generator, where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{g}$
\end_inset

 is the electrical power desired by the system, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{m}$
\end_inset

 is the mechanical power output of the turbine, 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle\omega$
\end_inset

 is the deviation in generator frequency (a.k.a.
 generator angular speed) from the nominal frequency of 60 Hz, 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle\dot{\omega}$
\end_inset

 is the first derivative with respect to time of the change in generator
 frequency (a.k.a.
 generator angular acceleration), and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 are damping constants.
 This equation shows that, with the mechanical power held constant, a decrease
 (increase) in desired generator power 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{g}$
\end_inset

 will result in an increase (decrease) in generator frequency.
 This is analogous to what we experience in a car when we begin going down
 a hill.
 If you were to keep pressing on the gas with the same pressure as you begin
 going down the hill (i.e.
 hold the mechanical power of your engine constant while decreasing the
 resistance against the car), the engine would speed up; this is why most
 of us decrease our gas pedal pressure as we descend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second equation simply states that the generator frequency (angular
 speed) 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is equal to the derivative of the generator angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third equation governs droop control, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{P}_{m}$
\end_inset

 is the change with respect to time of the mechanical power, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{ref}$
\end_inset

 is the set point of the system derived by economic dispatch, 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle P_{c}$
\end_inset

 is the change in the SOMETHINGGGG, and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{g}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 are scaling constants.
 Droop, also known as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

primary frequency control,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a control on the time scale of milliseconds to seconds which allows
 the mechanical output to change in order to help to correct deviation from
 nominal frequency.
 Without droop control, the mechanical power output cannot change and instead
 frequency must provide all of the buffer for when 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{g}$
\end_inset

 changes, causing frequency swings and significant grid performance issues.
 We see that the equation relates 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{P}_{m}$
\end_inset

 to the error between the set point of power and the actual power output
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(P_{ref}+\Delta P_{c}-P_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

 and to the error between the current frequency and the nominal frequency
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{\triangle\omega}{R}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This control, then, alters the mechanical output in response to these errors;
 if the desired power output is wrong, change the output, and if the frequency
 is too high or low, change the output (the frequency is directly related
 to the output via the swing equation).
 Comparing this with our above downhill car example, this is analogous to
 decreasing the pressure on the pedal; the difference between the actual
 power output and the necessary power output is non-zero, and thus we changing
 the mechanical output by moving our foot, instead of allowing the engine
 to increase speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fourth equation is a secondary frequency control, known as automatic
 generation control (AGC), which operates on the time scale of seconds to
 minutes, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{P}_{c}$
\end_inset

 is SOMETHINGGG, and, as the North American Electricity Reliability Council
 explains, ACE 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is used to determine a control area’s control performance with respects
 to its’ impact on system frequency.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain our control diagram, we take the Laplace transform of each of
 the above equations.
 Starting with equation 4, we have 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\triangle\dot{P}_{c}(t)=-k\cdot ACE(t)\rightarrow\mathcal{L}\rightarrow s\triangle P_{c}(s)=-k\cdot ACE(s)\rightarrow\triangle P_{c}(s)=\frac{-k}{s}\cdot ACE(s).
\]

\end_inset

 Thus, we see on our block diagram that ACE passes through a gain block
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{-k}{s}$
\end_inset

 to produce 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle P_{c}.$
\end_inset

 Additionally, we note that the limits to 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle P_{c}$
\end_inset

 are applied within this block, producing 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle P_{c_{lim}}.$
\end_inset

 Within the 3rd equation, we define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{c}(t)=P_{ref}(t)+\triangle P_{c_{lim}}(t)-\frac{\triangle\omega(t)}{R},
\]

\end_inset

 and taking the Laplace transform, we simply have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{c}(s)=P_{ref}(s)+\triangle P_{c_{lim}}(s)-\frac{\triangle\omega(s)}{R},
\]

\end_inset

 shown in the summation on the next step of the block diagram.
 Limiting this gives us 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c_{lim}}.$
\end_inset

 Then, equation 3 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{g}\dot{P}_{m}(t)=P_{c_{lim}}(t)-P_{m}(t).
\]

\end_inset

Taking the Laplace transform, the result is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
sT_{g}P_{m}(s)=P_{c_{lim}}(s)-P_{m}(s).
\]

\end_inset

Adding 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{m}$
\end_inset

 to the other side, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(sT_{g}+1\right)P_{m}(s)=P_{c_{lim}}(s)\rightarrow P_{m}=\left(\frac{1}{T_{g}s+1}\right)P_{c_{lim}}.
\]

\end_inset

 Lastly, we take the Laplace transform of equation one, resulting in 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
sM\triangle\omega(s)=P_{m}(s)-P_{g}(s)-D\triangle\omega(s).
\]

\end_inset

 Solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle\omega$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(Ms+D\right)\triangle\omega(s)=P_{m}(s)-P_{g}(s)\rightarrow\triangle\omega(s)=\frac{1}{Ms+D}\left(P_{m}(s)-P_{g}(s)\right).
\]

\end_inset

As noted above, a number of limits must be applied to the outputs, which
 is done to more accurately reflect the operation of a realistic system.
 The limit on 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle P_{c}$
\end_inset

 is applied to ensure that the regulation provided by a given generator
 stays within the defined percentage.
 The limit on 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

 ensures that the generator stays within its absolute maximum and minimum
 power output.
 We place a limit on 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{P}_{m}$
\end_inset

 to ensure that the generator ramping does not occur faster than is phsycially
 possible; a given generator can only change its output so quickly.
 Lastly, we apply a limit to 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle\dot{P}_{c}$
\end_inset

 to ensure that the system is not attempting to change 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle\dot{P}_{c}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle P_{c}$
\end_inset

 is already at its limit.
